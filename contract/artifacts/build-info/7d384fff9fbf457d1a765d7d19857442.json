(See also\n * {SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom}).\n *\n * Additionally, note that smart contract wallets (such as Argent or Safe) are not able to produce permit signatures, so\n * contracts should have entry points that don't rely on permit.\n */\ninterface IERC20Permit {\n    /**\n     * @dev Sets `value` as the allowance of `spender` over ``owner``'s tokens,\n     * given ``owner``'s signed approval.\n     *\n     * IMPORTANT: The same issues {IERC20-approve} has related to transaction\n     * ordering also apply here.\n     *\n     * Emits an {Approval} event.\n     *\n     * Requirements:\n     *\n     * - `spender` cannot be the zero address.\n     * - `deadline` must be a timestamp in the future.\n     * - `v`, `r` and `s` must be a valid `secp256k1` signature from `owner`\n     * over the EIP712-formatted function arguments.\n     * - the signature must use ``owner``'s current nonce (see {nonces}).\n     *\n     * For more information on the signature format, see the\n     * https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612#specification[relevant EIP\n     * section].\n     *\n     * CAUTION: See Security Considerations above.\n     */\n    function permit(\n        address owner,\n        address spender,\n        uint256 value,\n        uint256 deadline,\n        uint8 v,\n        bytes32 r,\n        bytes32 s\n    ) external;\n\n    /**\n     * @dev Returns the current nonce for `owner`.

The first is that a valid permit signature\n expresses an allowance, and it should not be assumed to convey additional meaning. In particular, it should not be\n considered as an intention to spend the allowance in any specific way. The second is that because permits have\n built-in replay protection and can be submitted by anyone, they can be frontrun. A protocol that uses permits should\n take this into consideration and allow a `permit` call to fail. Combining these two aspects, a pattern that may be\n generally recommended is:\n ```solidity\n function doThingWithPermit(..., uint256 value, uint256 deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) public {\n     try token.permit(msg.sender, address(this), value, deadline, v, r, s) {} catch {}\n     doThing(..., value);\n }\n function doThing(..., uint256 value) public {\n     token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), value);\n     ...\n }\n ```\n Observe that: 1) `msg.sender` is used as the owner, leaving no ambiguity as to the signer intent, and 2) the use of\n `try/catch` allows the permit to fail and makes the code tolerant to frontrunning. (See also\n {SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom}).\n Additionally, note that smart contract wallets (such as Argent or Safe) are not able to produce permit signatures, so\n contracts should have entry points that don't rely on permit."},"fullyImplemented":false,"id":399,"linearizedBaseContracts":[399],"name":"IERC20Permit","nameLocation":"2122:12:4","nodeType":"ContractDefinition","nodes":[{"documentation":{"id":367,"nodeType":"StructuredDocumentation","src":"2141:850:4","text":" @dev Sets `value` as the allowance of `spender` over ``owner``'s tokens,\n given ``owner``'s signed approval.\n IMPORTANT: The same issues {IERC20-approve} has related to transaction\n ordering also apply here.\n Emits an {Approval} event.\n Requirements:\n -

By not relying on {IERC20-approve}, the token holder account doesn't need to send a transaction, and thus is not required to hold Ether at all. ==== Security Considerations There are two important considerations concerning the use of `permit`. The first is that a valid permit signature expresses an allowance, and it should not be assumed to convey additional meaning. In particular, it should not be considered as an intention to spend the allowance in any specific way. The second is that because permits have built-in replay protection and can be submitted by anyone, they can be frontrun. A protocol that uses permits should take this into consideration and allow a `permit` call to fail. Combining these two aspects, a pattern that may be generally recommended is: ```solidity function doThingWithPermit(..., uint256 value, uint256 deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) public {     try token.permit(msg.sender, address(this), value, deadline, v, r, s) {} catch {}     doThing(..., value); } function doThing(..., uint256 value) public {     token.safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), value);     ... } ``` Observe that: 1) `msg.sender` is used as the owner, leaving no ambiguity as to the signer intent, and 2) the use of `try/catch` allows the permit to fail and makes the code tolerant to frontrunning. (See also {SafeERC20-safeTransferFrom}). Additionally, note that smart contract wallets (such as Argent or Safe) are not able to produce permit signatures, so contracts should have entry points that don't rely on permit.\",\"kind\":\"dev\",\"methods\":{\"DOMAIN_SEPARATOR()\":{\"details\":\"Returns the domain separator used in the encoding of the signature for {permit}, as defined by {EIP712}.\"},\"nonces(address)\":{\"details\":\"Returns the current nonce for `owner`.

IMPORTANT: The same issues {IERC20-approve} has related to transaction ordering also apply here. Emits an {Approval} event. Requirements: - `spender` cannot be the zero address. - `deadline` must be a timestamp in the future. - `v`, `r` and `s` must be a valid `secp256k1` signature from `owner` over the EIP712-formatted function arguments. - the signature must use ``owner``'s current nonce (see {nonces}). For more information on the signature format, see the https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612#specification[relevant EIP section]. CAUTION: See Security Considerations above.\"}},\"version\":1},\"userdoc\":{\"kind\":\"user\",\"methods\":{},\"version\":1}},\"settings\":{\"compilationTarget\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/IERC20Permit.sol\":\"IERC20Permit\"},\"evmVersion\":\"paris\",\"libraries\":{},\"metadata\":{\"bytecodeHash\":\"ipfs\"},\"optimizer\":{\"enabled\":true,\"runs\":200},\"remappings\":[],\"viaIR\":true},\"sources\":{\"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/IERC20Permit.sol\":{\"keccak256\":\"0xb264c03a3442eb37a68ad620cefd1182766b58bee6cec40343480392d6b14d69\",\"license\":\"MIT\",\"urls\":[\"bzz-raw://28879d01fd22c07b44f006612775f8577defbe459cb01685c5e25cd518c91a71\",\"dweb:/ipfs/QmVgfkwv2Fxw6hhTcDUZhE7NkoSKjab3ipM7UaRbt6uXb5\"]}},\"version\":1}"}},"@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/utils/SafeERC20.sol":{"SafeERC20":{"abi":[],"evm":{"bytecode":{"functionDebugData":{},"generatedSources":[],"linkReferences":{},"object":"60808060405234601757603a9081601d823930815050f35b600080fdfe600080fdfea2646970667358221220c05240e7affbf9d98fc9cb88366642a4c324f76b833b35e536ac621be9ef849064736f6c63430008140033","opcodes":"PUSH1 0x80 DUP1 PUSH1 0x40 MSTORE CALLVALUE PUSH1 0x17 JUMPI PUSH1 0x3A SWAP1 DUP2 PUSH1 0x1D DUP3 CODECOPY ADDRESS DUP2 POP POP RETURN JUMPDEST PUSH1 0x0 DUP1 REVERT INVALID PUSH1 0x0 DUP1 REVERT INVALID LOG2 PUSH5 0x6970667358 0x22 SLT KECCAK256 0xC0 MSTORE BLOCKHASH 0xE7 0xAF 0xFB 0xF9 0xD9 DUP16 0xC9 0xCB DUP9 CALLDATASIZE PUSH7 0x42A4C324F76B83 EXTCODESIZE CALLDATALOAD 0xE5 CALLDATASIZE 0xAC PUSH3 0x1BE9EF DUP5 SWAP1 PUSH5 0x736F6C6343 STOP ADDMOD EQ STOP CALLER ","sourceMap":"701:6234:5:-:0;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;"},"deployedBytecode":{"functionDebugData":{},"generatedSources":[],"immutableReferences":{},"linkReferences":{},"object":"600080fdfea2646970667358221220c05240e7affbf9d98fc9cb88366642a4c324f76b833b35e536ac621be9ef849064736f6c63430008140033","opcodes":"PUSH1 0x0 DUP1 REVERT INVALID LOG2 PUSH5 0x6970667358 0x22 SLT KECCAK256 0xC0 MSTORE BLOCKHASH 0xE7 0xAF 0xFB 0xF9 0xD9 DUP16 0xC9 0xCB DUP9 CALLDATASIZE PUSH7 0x42A4C324F76B83 EXTCODESIZE CALLDATALOAD 0xE5 CALLDATASIZE 0xAC PUSH3 0x1BE9EF DUP5 SWAP1 PUSH5 0x736F6C6343 STOP ADDMOD EQ STOP CALLER ","sourceMap":"701:6234:5:-:0;;"},"methodIdentifiers":{}},"metadata":"{\"compiler\":{\"version\":\"0.8.20+commit.a1b79de6\"},\"language\":\"Solidity\",\"output\":{\"abi\":[],\"devdoc\":{\"details\":\"Wrappers around ERC20 operations that throw on failure (when the token contract returns false).
